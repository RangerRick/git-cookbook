# Sourdough Baguettes ([source](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-baguettes-recipe))

This recipe seems to be pretty foolproof, and is easy to mess with if you want to try some variations.

Make 4 loaves instead of 3 to get smaller, 2" almost breadsticky loaves.
Make 2 to get larger Italian-style loaves.

Just keep an eye on them when baking, you probably have to adjust the timing.

## Ingredients

* 140g (5/8 cup) water, lukewarm
* 280g (1 cup) sourdough starter
* 270g to 300g (2 1/4 to 3) all-purpose flour
* 1 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 0 to 1 1/2 tsp yeast (depends on how healthy/recently fed your starter is; if you're using discard, give it a heaping teaspoon)
* 2 tsp vital wheat gluten (if you don't have this, you might try using bread flour instead of all-purpose)

## Directions

1. In stand mixer bowl, combine water, starter, and 180g (1 1/2 cups) of the flour, and mix until integrated.
2. Cover and let sit for 5-10 minutes.
3. Add the rest of the flour, and the other ingredients, and stir until combined, then mix with a dough hook for 7-8 minutes. It should make a strong, smooth dough ball.
4. Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl to proof, for about 90 minutes. (Personally, I just pull the dough ball out, rub a little olive oil on it, and stick it back in the stand mixer bowl.)
5. Deflate the dough, and break in to 3 even pieces.
6. Roll the dough into small long loaves and place on a baking sheet (or two) lined with parchment paper. This video from [Le Chef's Wife](https://lechefswife.com/baking-baguettes-for-beginners/) is a really nice example of the technique. <video width="320" controls><source src="https://lechefswife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kOEow6lQO2BCvwLFaFw.mov"></video>
7. Cover the loaves with lightly-greased plastic wrap (or dust a little flour on them) and let them rise for 1-2 hours. The rise time will depend a lot on how active your yeast is, how much commercial yeast you added, and the temperature of your kitchen.

## Baking

Near the end of the loaf rise, preheat your oven to 450Â°F.

If you want a classic look, slash the tops with a knife.
If you skip this the loaves will get a little more rise in the oven.

Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.
Turn off the oven and crack the door, and leave them for 10 more minutes.

For a more chewy Italian loaf style, take them out a bit more on the early side (when just browning) and skip the cracked door step.
