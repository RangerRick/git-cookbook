# Sourdough Discard Pancakes ([source](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/sourdough-discard-pancakes/))

A nice basic pancake recipe that uses sourdough discard.
I like it because you get a bit of that buttermilk-like "tang" from the sourdough, but you don't have to keep buttermilk on hand.

## Ingredients

* 280g (2 cups) all-purpose flour
* 150g (~1 cup) sourdough discard -- more or less is ok
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 3 tbsp Sugar
* 400g (1 3/4 cups) milk
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tbsp canola oil
* 1 tsp salt

## Directions

Place your skillet on the stove and heat it on medium-low heat for 15 minutes. Aim for a temperature of about 300ºF for cooking pancakes.
Low and slow is better for pancakes to ensure a nice golden brown crust and a soft and fluffy interior.

Combine all your ingredients in one bowl and mix until combined. It's OK if it’s a little lumpy.

Melt a teaspoon of butter in the skillet. Butter adds some delicious crispiness to your pancakes. (I tend to just use a nonstick pan and skip this step.)

Pour about 1/2 cup of batter into the skillet and cook for 5 minutes or until the edges of the pancake start to look dried out and you can see some holes forming on top.

Flip your pancake over and cook for another 3 minutes.

Serve immediately with butter and syrup.
Or don't! See if I care!
