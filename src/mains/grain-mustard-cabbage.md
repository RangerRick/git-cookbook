# Grain Mustard Cabbage with Hot and Sweet Sausage ([source](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipe/grain-mustard-cabbage-hot-and-sweet-sausage))

## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 2 1/2 tablespoon whole grain mustard
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 small head Napa cabbage (about 1 1/2 pounds), shredded
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 2 (1/4-pound) links hot chicken sausage
* 2 (1/4-pound) links sweet chicken sausage
* 3 tablespoons seedless raisins
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.

In a small bowl combine the vinegar and mustard; set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.
Add sausage and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown all over, about 2 minutes per side.
Transfer sausage to a baking dish, bake for 10 minutes, then cut into small chunks.

Meanwhile, in the same skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil.
Working in batches, add cabbage and cook until just tender, about 3 to 5 minutes per batch. (Keep the batches small so the cabbage cooks quickly.)
Transfer cooked cabbage to a serving bowl and season with salt and pepper.

Add reserved vinegar mixture, raisins and sausage to cabbage and toss to combine.
