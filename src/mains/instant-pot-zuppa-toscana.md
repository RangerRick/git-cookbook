# Instant Pot Zuppa Toscana (Olive Garden Copycat) ([source](https://marginmakingmom.com/instant-pot-zuppa-toscana/))

This makes a pretty good clone of the Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana, a rich sausage and potato soup.

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 lb ground mild Italian sausage
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 large russet potatoes, unpeeled and sliced into 1/4-inch slices.
* 6 cups (1 1/2 quarts) chicken broth
* 2 cups fresh kale or spinach, chopped
* 3/4 cup heavy cream, half and half, or milk

## Directions

Using the "saute" function of the Instant Pot, heat the olive oil.
Add the onions and cook until they begin to become translucent.

1. Add the Italian sausage, crumbling up into smaller pieces and cooking until browned.
2. Add the garlic and allow to cook just until fragrant, about a minute.
3. Drain off excess grease if desired and return to pot.
4. Add potato slices and chicken broth.
5. Lock the lid into place and set to "sealed."
   Cook at high pressure for 5 minutes using the Manual setting.
6. When cooking is complete, allow a natural pressure release for 10 minutes, followed by a quick release.
7. When pressure valve has dropped, remove the lid and add the kale or spinach to the pot.
   The heat from the soup will wilt the greens as you stir.
8. Pour in the cream/half and half/milk, stirring to combine.
