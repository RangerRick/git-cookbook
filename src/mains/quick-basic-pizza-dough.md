# Quick Basic Pizza Dough ([source](https://www.marthastewart.com/332275/basic-pizza-dough))

Yes, yes, I know, Martha Stewart. But it's a good basic pizza dough recipe, and I got introduced to it by a friend who swears by it.  It's good!

You can vary the type of flour to change the texture (AP flour is fine, bread flour is higher protein and will get you closer to NY style).

## Ingredients

* 350g (1.5 cups) water
* 480g (4 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled), plus more for dusting
* 2 envelopes (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast (not rapid-rise)
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for bowl and brushing
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt

## Directions

Pour 1 1/2 cups warm water into a large bowl; sprinkle with yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Whisk sugar, oil, and salt into yeast mixture.
Add flour and stir until a sticky dough forms.

Transfer dough to an oiled bowl and brush top with oil.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 1 or 2 times before using.

## Notes

Dough can be stored in an oiled bowl, covered with plastic, in refrigerator up to 2 hours.
To freeze, wrap dough in plastic and freeze in a resealable freezer bag up to 3 months.

I generally split this dough into 3 (to make slightly thinner crust) and freeze the extras.

When baking, I spread this out into my Detroit style pan and poke some holes with a fork, and then bake it in a 450Â°F oven.
I pre-bake the crust for 6 minutes, add 8oz mozzarella and sauce (see [the Detroit recipe](./detroit-style-pizza.md#sauce-and-toppings) for my go-to sauce recipe), and then put it back in and bake it for another 16 minutes.
Your oven/mileage may vary.
