# Winter Salad Hummus Bowl ([source](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/winter-salad-hummus-bowls))

This makes a delicious healthy lunch and you can prep all the parts ahead of time pretty easily.

We have made some modifications to this slightly, most notably lightly cooking the kale and sprouts.
We prefer the texture that way.

## Ingredients

### Dressing

* 5 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
* 1 Tbsp. honey
* 1 Tbsp. tamari or soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (plus more for cooking)

### Salad

* 4â€“6 large hard-boiled eggs
* 1 bunch curly kale, stems removed, torn into bite-size pieces
* 1 lb. brussels sprouts, trimmed, thinly sliced
* 1 cup store-bought or homemade hummus
* 1 cup seeds or nuts for topping
* sea salt

## Directions

### Make the Dressing

Combine all of the dressing ingredients in a jar or similar and shake vigorously before using.

### Prep the Salad

Wilt the kale and cook the brussels sprouts.
We don't brown them, but just cook until they soften.

Swoosh about 1/4 cup hummus onto side of each bowl.

Add the kale and sprouts, then top with egg halves; season eggs with sea salt to taste.

Drizzle the dressing over and top with seeds.
