# World's Best Black Bean Hummus

The source for this I believe started as some variation of the hummus from [the Eat to Live books](https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Live-Amazing-Nutrient-Rich-Sustained/dp/031612091X), but we modified it enough that it's pretty much its own thing now.

It works just as well if you use garbanzo beans instead of the black beans.

## Ingredients

* 1 15oz can black beans, partially drained
* 2 Tbsp lemon juice
* 2 Tbsp raw tahini
* 2 Tbsp soy sauce (or liquid aminos)
* 2 Tbsp [Penzeyâ€™s florida pepper](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/florida-seasoned-pepper/c-24/p-165/pd-s) seasoning (this is the secret weapon)
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 cloves garlic
* pinch of cayenne powder, to taste
* pinch of paprika

## Directions

Blend all ingredients except the paprika in food processor with 2 tbsp bean liquid.
Process until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.

Add additional seasoning and liquid to taste.

Top with paprika.
