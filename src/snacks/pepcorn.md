# Pepcorn -- Spicy Chili Popcorn ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fG8rNHUspU))

This is based on a recipe for "Pepcorn," a creation of Brian David Gilbert.
I strongly recommend watching his actual video on how to make it, because it's hilarious.

However, this version is adapted [from another YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOHcChzvh7E)
where someone simplified the process a bit by pre-making "pepcorn salt."

## Extract Pepcorn Salt and Chili Oil

* 2-3 tbsp of [Lao Gan Ma](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074PXK75Y)
* 1-2 tbsp of kosher salt

Get a small bowl and a sieve, and separate the oil from the other stuff in the Lao Gan Ma.
Use a paper towel to squeeze as much moisture out of the remaining particulates as possible.

Add the particulates and the salt to a mortar, and grind until fine.

Place on a pan lined with parchment paper and put in the oven.
Set the oven to 200Â°F and then turn it off.  Leave in the oven 24 hours to cool and dry out.
Store in an airtight container.

## Pepcorn

* 1/2 cup popcorn kernels
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 tbsp chili oil (from above, reserve 1 tbsp)
* 2 tsp pepcorn salt
* 1 tsp chili powder (or to taste)

Add 2 tbsp of the chili oil plus the vegetable oil to a wok, and then put the popcorn in.

Cover with heavy-duty aluminum foil.

Bring to medium-high heat, shaking the wok occasionally, then drop the heat to medium when the popcorn starts to pop.
Continue to shake regularly, until the popping slows to 5 seconds between pops, then turn off the heat.
Wait a few more moments for all popping to stop and then remove the foil.

Transfer the results to a bowl, add the remainder of the chili oil, the pepcorn salt, and the chili powder, and mix until even.
